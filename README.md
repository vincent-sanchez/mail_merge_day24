# 100 Days of Code | Day 24 | Turtle Mail Merge

main.py file was created for Day 24 of the 100 Days of Code: Python course from Dr. Angela Yu. 

This project uses 1 python file to read a list of names from the 'invited_names.txt' file provided. The program then reads the 'starting_letter.txt' file that replaces the value of '[name]' with each value in the list from 'invited_names'.txt. After replacing the name, a new file gets created with the name of the being the value from the list of names.
